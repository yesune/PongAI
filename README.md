# PongAI
Genetic Algorithm

NOTE ON DEPENDENCIES - I HAVE NOT INCLUDED THE FILES, SO SOME FUNCTIONS MAY NOT WORK IF YOU TRY IT YOURSELF

Description
PongAI is a Java implementation of a genetic algorithm that can play a custom-made pong game.

100 AI agents are generated each generation, and the more points an agent scores, the greater there chances at "reproducing" are.
All 50 matches are played simutaneously for efficient training, first to 3 points.
New agents are generated through crossovers and mutations.

I have provided several graphs if you would like to see the training history and how they have evolved over time.
